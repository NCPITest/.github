# <p align="center"> NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) Program TEST PAGE  </p>

Welcome to the test NCPI GitHub page! 

The NCPI program is a partnership between multiple NIH-supported participating systems (currently AnVIL, BioData Catalyst, CRDC, dbGaP, and Kids First) developing and implementing technical standards to enable interoperability and facilitate a federated data ecosystem. 

The purpose of this page is two fold: 
  - Provide links to the technical products that underlie interoperability, These tools/resources/services are outlined in the Interoperability Resources Table.
  - Provide information regarding the NCPI program more broadly
    - The [About](https://github.com/NCPITest/About/blob/main/README.md) repository provides an overview of the NCPI program and its components.
    - The [Partners](https://github.com/NCPITest/Partners/blob/main/README.md) repository provides details on the NCPI partner systems.
    - The [Projects](https://github.com/NCPITest/Projects/blob/main/README.md) repository provides an overview of ongoing and past interoperability projects.
    - The [Resources](https://github.com/NCPITest/Resources/blob/main/README.md) repository provides various interoperability resources inlcuding information about key NCPI standards such as Researcher Auth Service, Data Repository Service, and FHIR. 
  

## Interoperability Resources Table

The following table provides a quick overview of the interoperability focused tools/resources/services that underlie NCPI. 

| <p align="center">Repository</p> | <p align="center">Description</p> |
|--------|---------------|
| [NCPI FHIR Implementation Guide 2](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-ig-2?tab=readme-ov-file) | Relaunch of the IG project with a clearer focus, an explicit style guide using the current tools including Sushi v3. |
| [FHIR Aggregator](https://fhir-aggregator.github.io/) | An open-access tool for finding and downloading biomedical data from across the NIH developed by [Interoperability Project 007](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/Interoperability-Projects/blob/main/Project%20Descriptions/Connecting%20FHIR%2C%20the%20CDA%2C%20and%20DRS%20Across%20NIH%20Cloud%20Resources.md).  | 
| [NCPI FHIR Shiny Browser](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-shiny-browser) | Example R Shiny applications and supporting functions that allow browsing and parsing FHIR objects. |
| [Locutus](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/locutus) | Backend for a web-based terminology mapping tool aimed at harmonizing dataset terms with public ontologies such as MeSH, HPO, and others. |
| [NCPI FHIR Client](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-client) | Basic FHIR client with built-in modular authentication. |
| [HAPI Dev](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/HAPI-Dev) | Helper to launch a local FHIR server that persists using local storage and has some pre-defined defaults built in. |
| [NCPI Whistler](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-whistler) | Pipeline to transform research data tables into FHIR resources and load them into a FHIR Server using Python scripting, Whistle, and the FHIR Rest API. |
| [NCPI Whistler Tutorial](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/NCPI-Whistler-Tutorial) | Step-by-step guide for creating a project to transform research data into FHIR resources and optionally load them into a FHIR server. |
| [Dockerized Whistle](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/dockerized-whistle) | Docker image for a fully functional whistle application with a shell script for easy execution. |
| [map-dragon](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/map-dragon).| This application will support several user groups in submitting and validating their data, managing and tracking data definitions, and aligning data to standardized terms.|
