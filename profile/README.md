# <p align="center"> NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) Program TEST PAGE  </p>

Welcome to the test NCPI GitHub page! 

The NCPI program is a partnership between multiple NIH-supported participating systems (currently AnVIL, BioData Catalyst, CRDC, dbGaP, and Kids First) developing and implementing technical standards to enable interoperability and facilitate a federated data ecosystem. For more information about participating systems, click [here.](https://github.com/NCPITest/Interoperability-Resources/blob/main/Partner%20Systems.md)

The purpose of this page is to serve as a technical hub for the NCPI community including providing:
- Information on the current interoperability work that is occurring
- Introductions and links to the services and tools that are fundamental to NCPI

## Repository Overview

The following table provides a quick overview of the organization of the NCPI GitHub:

| <p align="center">Repository</p> | <p align="center">Description</p> |
|--------|---------------|
| [Interoperability Projects](https://github.com/NCPI-test/NCPI-Interoperability-Projects-Test) | Repository with files that briefly describe each interoperability project and link to their respective project repositories for actual development. <br/> **Repository Structure:** <br> - `Overview`: Project documentation <br> - `Projects`: Descriptions of the projects with links to their repositories |
| [NCPI FHIR Implementation Guide 2](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-ig-2?tab=readme-ov-file) | Relaunch of the IG project with a clearer focus, an explicit style guide using the current tools including Sushi v3. |
| [NCPI FHIR Shiny Browser](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-shiny-browser) | Example R Shiny applications and supporting functions that allow browsing and parsing FHIR objects. |
| [Locutus](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/locutus) | Backend for a web-based terminology mapping tool aimed at harmonizing dataset terms with public ontologies such as MeSH, HPO, and others. |
| [NCPI FHIR Client](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-client) | Basic FHIR client with built-in modular authentication. |
| [HAPI Dev](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/HAPI-Dev) | Helper to launch a local FHIR server that persists using local storage and has some pre-defined defaults built in. |
| [NCPI Whistler](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-whistler) | Pipeline to transform research data tables into FHIR resources and load them into a FHIR Server using Python scripting, Whistle, and the FHIR Rest API. |
| [NCPI Whistler Tutorial](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/NCPI-Whistler-Tutorial) | Step-by-step guide for creating a project to transform research data into FHIR resources and optionally load them into a FHIR server. |
| [Dockerized Whistle](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/dockerized-whistle) | Docker image for a fully functional whistle application with a shell script for easy execution. |
| [map-dragon](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/map-dragon).| This application will support several user groups in submitting and validating their data, managing and tracking data definitions, and aligning data to standardized terms.|
